    <h1>Welcome to the BCU Labs Bike Stress Map!</h1>
        <p>
        BCU Labs is working to build data-backed tools to help people identify the strengths and weaknesses of the biking 
        network in Greater Boston. We aim to help provide the vocabulary to communicate your experience biking in Boston. 
        <br /> <br />
        The Bike Stress Map is our first project, rating every street in Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, and Brookline based 
        on how comfortable it is to ride a bike on. Start clicking around the map below to see your neighborhood or commute. 
        Maybe you will find a new, more comfortable route. Keep scrolling to read up in more detail how we are rating streets 
        and what you can do to improve the map.
